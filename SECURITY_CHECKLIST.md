# 🔒 Lockr Security Implementation Checklist

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Argon2id password hashing with salt
- [ ] JWT access tokens (15min expiry)
- [ ] HTTP-only refresh cookies (7d expiry)
- [ ] Token blacklisting on logout
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication preparation
- [ ] Password strength validation
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts

## 🛡️ Data Protection
- [ ] AES-256-GCM encryption for vault data
- [ ] Key derivation from master password (PBKDF2/Argon2)
- [ ] Zero-knowledge architecture (server never sees plaintext)
- [ ] Secure key storage and rotation
- [ ] Database field-level encryption
- [ ] Memory clearing after crypto operations

## 🚦 Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] Request payload validation (express-validator)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS protection (helmet, content escaping)
- [ ] CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- [ ] File upload restrictions
- [ ] JSON parsing limits
- [ ] URL parameter validation

## 🔒 Network Security
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement (redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
- [ ] HSTS headers (helmet)
- [ ] Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- [ ] CORS configuration (restricted origins)
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)

## ⚡ Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- [ ] API rate limiting (per IP/user)
- [ ] Login attempt rate limiting (stricter)
- [ ] Password reset rate limiting
- [ ] Request size limits (body parser)
- [ ] Slowloris protection
- [ ] Distributed rate limiting (Redis-based)

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Security event logging (Winston)
- [ ] Failed authentication tracking
- [ ] Suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Audit trail for vault access
- [ ] Error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Log rotation and secure storage
- [ ] Real-time alerting for security events

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Environment variable protection (.env validation)
- [ ] Database connection security (SSL, cert validation)
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit)
- [ ] Container security (future Docker implementation)
- [ ] Backup encryption
- [ ] Secrets management
- [ ] Database access controls

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for all security functions
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] Penetration testing scenarios
- [ ] Security regression tests
- [ ] Load testing under attack simulation
- [ ] Crypto function tests (encrypt/decrypt cycles)
- [ ] Edge case security testing

## 📋 Compliance & Best Practices
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 compliance
- [ ] GDPR data protection considerations
- [ ] Password policy enforcement
- [ ] Session management security
- [ ] Secure development lifecycle
- [ ] Code review security checklist
- [ ] Security documentation
