**Progress: 31/50 items completed (62%)**

### 🔥 Recent Achievements (TDD Cycle 4: AuthController):
✅ **Complete Authentication API** - All authentication endpoints implemented  
✅ **Comprehensive Validation** - Email, password strength, request data validation  
✅ **Security Controls** - Password verification, token management, account protection  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful error handling without information disclosure  
✅ **44 AuthController Tests** - Complete test coverage for all authentication flows  
✅ **107 Total Tests Passing** - Robust test suite across all components

### 🎯 Next Priority Items:
1. **Database Integration** - Replace in-memory storage with PostgreSQL
2. **Enhanced Rate Limiting** - Implement auth-specific rate limiting
3. **Account Lockout** - Prevent brute force attacks
4. **Input Validation Middleware** - Centralized validation layer
5. **Multi-factor Authentication** - TOTP/SMS preparation
