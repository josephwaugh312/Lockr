  ```
  Messages are sent by Lockrr Password Manager to its existing customers for security and authentication purposes. 
  This includes two-factor authentication codes, security alerts for suspicious login attempts, account lockout notifications, 
  password reset confirmations, new device login alerts, and system maintenance notifications. 
  Customers opt-in during account registration or through account settings to receive these security-critical notifications.
  ```

#### Message Flow/Call-to-Action (CRITICAL - This was the rejection reason)
```
End users opt-in to SMS notifications during account registration at lockrr.app by providing their phone number and checking the SMS notifications checkbox. Users can also add or update their phone number in their account settings after registration. Opt-in occurs when users explicitly agree to receive security notifications and verification codes for their password manager account. Users can opt-out at any time by replying STOP to any message or by updating their notification preferences in their account settings. All messages are transactional and security-focused for password management services.

IMPORTANT: You must provide a screenshot of your opt-in process hosted on a publicly accessible website (like Google Drive, OneDrive, or your own website) and include the URL in this field.
