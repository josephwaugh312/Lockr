# Test Suite Fixes Applied

## Phase 1: ItemModal.test.tsx Label Fixes ✅
- Changed all `screen.getByLabelText('Name')` to `screen.getByLabelText(/Item Name/i)` 
- Changed all `screen.getByLabelText('Username')` to `screen.getByLabelText(/Username/i)`
- Added missing `const user = userEvent.setup()` declarations to all tests that were missing them
- Changed all save button references from `/Save/i` to `/Add Item/i` to match actual component text
- Fixed timer management by adding `jest.useFakeTimers()` and `jest.useRealTimers()` appropriately

## Phase 2: NotificationBell.test.tsx Date Property Fixes ✅
- Changed `createdAt` to `created_at` in mock data to match actual component expectations
- This aligns with the NotificationItem.tsx component which expects `notification.created_at`

## Phase 3: Timer and Timeout Issues ✅
- Added proper timer setup and teardown in tests using fake timers
- Ensured all tests using `jest.useFakeTimers()` also call `jest.useRealTimers()` in cleanup

## Phase 4: Performance Optimizations ✅
- Tests were timing out due to improper timer management
- Fixed by ensuring proper timer cleanup after each test

## Files Modified:
1. `/tests/components/ItemModal.test.tsx` - Fixed all label references and button names
2. `/src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.test.tsx` - Fixed date property name
3. Created `/tests/components/ItemModal.quick.test.tsx` for rapid testing of fixes

## Test Results:
