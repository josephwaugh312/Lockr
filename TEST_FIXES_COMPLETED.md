## Current Status

### ItemModal.test.tsx: 
- **27 tests still failing** out of 53 total
- 26 tests passing

### Remaining Issues to Fix:
The remaining 27 failures are likely due to:
1. More label mismatches we haven't caught yet
2. Tests that need required fields added for validation to pass
3. Async timing issues with auto-save tests
4. Possible issues with mock setup or test environment

## Next Steps

To achieve 100% passing tests:
1. Run ItemModal.test.tsx with verbose output to identify exact failure reasons
2. Fix each remaining failure systematically
3. Run vaultController.comprehensive.test.js to ensure those fixes work
4. Run full test suite to verify all tests pass
5. Verify coverage thresholds are met
